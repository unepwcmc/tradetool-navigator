",Initiative/organisation,Other,"The Forests Dialogue convened a scoping dialogue in October 2014 to seek to better understand the commitments that have been made to date, to unpack the ‘deforestation-free’ concept, and to explore the key questions that need to be answered if deforestation-free policies are to succeed in reducing deforestation on the ground. The first in a series of field dialogues took place in Riau, Indonesia in April-May 2015, and in Mouila, Gabon in October 2017.  These field dialogues provided participants an opportunity to explore the challenges and opportunities for implementing deforestation-free commitments in the unique contexts of Indonesia and West/Central Africa.

,CITES Wildlife TradeView,https://tradeview.cites.org/,CITES; UNEP-WCMC,Visualisation / dashboard; Database,Wildlife,"CITES Wildlife TradeView is an interactive online tool for exploring and visualising CITES trade data. It enables users to visualise trends in international wildlife trade through three separate views: Global overview, Country view and Taxon view. Within each view, users can identify the top exporters, importers, trade terms, taxa in trade and source of the specimens in trade (e.g. wild, captive-bred) using custom filters. Individual graphs and accompanying data can also be downloaded. The tool is directly linked to the CITES Trade Database (managed by UNEP-WCMC on behalf of the CITES Secretariat) and is automatically updated once CITES annual reports are entered into the trade database. It therefore provides a way to access the most up to date CITES trade data available. ",Global,Global,Annually,Not specified,species@unep-wcmc.org
