Reliable statistical information – statistics and indicators used in the analysis of international trade, investment and development – is indispensable for the formulation of sound economic policies and recommendations. This, in turn, is essential to fostering social and economic development.
UNCTAD compiles, validates and processes a wide range of data collected from national and international sources. Most time-series data cover extended periods of time, with some dating back to 1948, for almost all the economies of the world.
This allows the analysis of emerging and urgent issues within a framework of long-lasting tendencies and wide geographical scope. In case of missing data or a break in series, UNCTAD applies its expertise and methodology to make estimates. Such continuity together with accurateness and timeliness are the pillars of UNCTAD’s statistics.
Our statistics are grounded in continuity, accuracy and timeliness. UNCTAD’s statistical work also conforms to the United Nations principles governing international statistical activities, formulated with significant contributions from us. It is supported by the UNCTAD Statistics Quality Assurance Framework.
UNCTAD produces more than 150 indicators and statistical time series essential for the analysis of international trade, economic trends, foreign direct investment, external financial resources, population and labour force, commodities, the information economy and maritime transport.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Trade Tools Inventory JP 2020; search term: Trade data animal skins,,,,,,,,,,,79 TTI,

Any company active in the trade of goods and services understands this, too, but this can become more challenging when trade involves parties in different countries. As part of blockchain-based trade finance platform Contour, we are digitising the 400-year-old process of paper letters of credit together with other global banks and financial consultants. In 2018 and 2019 several pilots were carried out which showed that full digitisation reduces the time from initiation-to-payment by 9-11 days. As well as saving time, users will also enjoy transaction risk reduction as a result of better availability and matching capabilities of their data.
The coming months and years will be exciting as the next steps in Contour’s journey are the onboarding onto BETA Network, in which continuous testing is possible and a go-into-production is expected in the near future. Contour could disrupt one of the oldest products in trade finance to the benefit of trade finance banks, suppliers, buyers, logistics providers and others involved in international trade.
As an investor in Contour and one of the initiating members of the project, ING is in an excellent  position to guide the next steps of this blockchain based-innovation project.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

224 TTI,Land Portal,https://landportal.org/,The Land Portal Foundation,,,,Other - initiative/organisation; Data portal; Digital reports,Trade,,"The Land Portal Foundation was established to create, curate and disseminate land governance information by fostering an inclusive and accessible data landscape. Over the last decade, the portal has evolved from a simple information gateway to become a knowledge broker, a resource base, a vibrant online community of users and a trusted voice within global land governance. The Land Portal Foundation believes that access to information is crucial for achieving good land governance and securing land rights for landless and vulnerable people. Improving access to land-related data and information is our mission. This is what we do:
 Provide a platform for land data, publications, news, blogs, multimedia content and much more from an international network of organizations and institutions. Aggregating diverse and highly dispersed content helps to make hidden data available to everyone.
Nurture the information ecosystem by linking land databases, bringing fragmented data collections together and enriching content with metadata that complies with Open Data standards and principles. Fostering a healthy and diverse ecosystem of land-related information helps to improve the potential impact of data and ensures information is easily searchable and discoverable.
Stimulate debate among those working on land-related issues around the world through events, discussions and webinars. Online and offline dialogues help raise awareness of hidden issues (e.g. sexual extortion in the land sector) and provide opportunities for collaboration between diverse groups and organizations.
Visualize and synthesize data from diverse sources into unique portfolios of contextualized and actionable land governance information. Our thematic and country portfolios provide free virtual repositories of bibliographic and multimedia resources, helping to reveal new trends and expose existing gaps in the information landscape.
Support information providers from the land sector to utilize Open Data standards and encourage the creation and uptake of a standards-based data infrastructure based upon FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) principles. The increased adoption of commonly agreed data standards is helping information derived from local groups, national organizations and international institutions to coexist within the wider information ecosystem.
Explain and monitor indicators on land governance including the Sustainable Development Goals, the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure (VGGTs) and other international/regional frameworks for land monitoring. Showcasing and examining land monitoring instruments is helping to raise awareness and increase uptake of key indicators.
The work of the Land Portal is designed to achieve our three core objectives
Improve the documentation, mapping and monitoring of land governance issues.
Democratize the information ecosystem and strengthen flows of land governance data, from all perspectives and all levels.
Promote, inform and enrich the global debate on land issues.
We implement a range of programs and activities, calibrated to meet these core objectives. ",,,,,,,,,,Global,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
